FROM Friend
JOIN Highschooler H1
ON H1.ID = Friend.ID1
Join Highschooler H2
On H2.ID = Friend.ID2
Where H2.name = "Gabriel"

JOIN Highschooler H1
ON H1.ID = Likes.ID1
Join Highschooler H2
On H2.ID = Likes.ID2
Where H1.grade - H2.grade>=2

Q3. For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order. 

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM
(SELECT L1.ID1 as ID1, L1.ID2 as ID2
FROM likes L1, likes L2
WHERE L1.ID1 = L2.ID2 and L1.ID2 = L2.ID1) AS A

JOIN Highschooler H1 on H1.ID = A.ID1
JOIN Highschooler H2 on H2.ID = A.ID2
WHERE H1.name<H2.name
ORDER BY H1.name

Q4. Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade. 

SELECT name, grade
FROM Highschooler

(SELECT ID1 as ID FROM likes 
UNION
SELECT ID2 as ID FROM likes)
ORDER BY grade, name
 
Q5. For every situation where student A likes student B, but we have no information about whom B likes (that is, B does not appear as an ID1 in the Likes table), return A and B's names and grades. 

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Likes L
WHERE H1.ID = L.ID1 and H2.ID = L.ID2 and H2.ID not in (SELECT ID1 from Likes)

Q6. Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade. 

SELECT DISTINCT H1.name, H1.grade
FROM Friend
JOIN Highschooler H1 ON H1.ID = Friend.ID1
JOIN Highschooler H2 ON H2.ID = Friend.ID2
WHERE H1.ID NOT IN 
(SELECT ID1 FROM Friend, Highschooler H11, Highschooler H22
WHERE H11.ID = Friend.ID1 and H22.ID = Friend.ID2 and H11.Grade!=H22.Grade)
ORDER BY H1.GRADE,H1.name

Q7.
select distinct H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
from Highschooler H1, Likes, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, Friend F1, Friend F2
where H1.ID = Likes.ID1 and Likes.ID2 = H2.ID and
  H2.ID not in (select ID2 from Friend where ID1 = H1.ID) and
  H1.ID = F1.ID1 and F1.ID2 = H3.ID and
  H3.ID = F2.ID1 and F2.ID2 = H2.ID;

Q8. Find the difference between the number of students in the school and the number of different first names. 

SELECT COUNT(*)-COUNT(DISTINCT name) as DIFF
FROM Highschooler

Q9. Find the name and grade of all students who are liked by more than one other student.

JOIN likes
ON highschooler.id = likes.id2
group by id2
having count(id2) >1
