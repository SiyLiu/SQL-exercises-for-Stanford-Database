Q1. For every situation where student A likes student B, but student B likes a different student C, return the names and grades of A, B, and C. 

SELECT H1.name, H1.grade, H2.name, H2.grade, H3.name, H3.grade
FROM Highschooler H1, Highschooler H2, Highschooler H3, Likes L1, Likes L2
WHERE H1.ID = L1.ID1 and H2.ID = L1.ID2 and H2.ID = L2.ID1 
and H1.ID not in (SELECT ID2 FROM Likes Where ID1=H2.ID) and H3.ID = L2.ID2

Q2. Find those students for whom all of their friends are in different grades from themselves. Return the students' names and grades

SELECT DISTINCT H1.name, H1.grade
FROM Friend
JOIN Highschooler H1 ON H1.ID = Friend.ID1
JOIN Highschooler H2 ON H2.ID = Friend.ID2
WHERE H1.Grade!=H2.Grade and H1.ID not in
(SELECT FF.ID1 from Friend FF, Highschooler H11, Highschooler H22
Where FF.ID1 = H11.ID and FF.ID2 = H22.ID and H11.Grade = H22.Grade)

Q3. What is the average number of friends per student? (Your result should be just one number.)  

SELECT AVG(NUM) as AVG_NUM
FROM(

SELECT ID1, COUNT(*) as NUM
FROM Friend
GROUP BY ID1
)

Q4.Find the number of students who are either friends with Cassandra or are friends of friends of Cassandra. Do not count Cassandra, even though technically she is a friend of a friend. 

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
(SELECT ID2 FROM Friend
WHERE ID1 = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = "Cassandra")
UNION
SELECT F1.ID1
FROM Friend F1, Friend F2
WHERE F1.ID2!=(SELECT ID FROM Highschooler 
WHERE name = "Cassandra")
AND F1.ID2 = F2.ID1 and F1.ID1!=(SELECT ID FROM Highschooler 
WHERE name = "Cassandra")
AND F2.ID2 =(SELECT ID FROM Highschooler 
WHERE name = "Cassandra")) as A

-Solution 2
SELECT COUNT(id1)
FROM Friend
WHERE Id2 in(
SELECT id1 FROM Friend
WHERE id2 = (SELECT id from highschooler where name = "Cassandra"))
and id2!= (SELECT id from highschooler where name = "Cassandra")

Q5. 
SELECt distinct  name, grade
FROM Highschooler, Friend, (SELECT id1, count(*) as num from friend group by id1 ) as A
WHERE Highschooler.ID = Friend.ID1 and Highschooler.ID = A.id1 and num = (select max(num) from (SELECT id1, count(*) as num from friend group by id1 ) )

select h.name, h.grade from highschooler h, friend f where
h.id = f.id1 group by f.id1 having count(f.id2) = (
select max(r.c) from
(select count(id2) as c from friend group by id1) as r)
